    "Uncertainty is a facininating concept. It is extremely vast and applies to almost all aspects of life. You could spend your entire life learning about it and still not understand all of it.\n",
    "Uncertainty is everywhere, in everything we do. For example, uncertainty affects the economy in many ways. Peoples attitude to spending are usually based on their level of confidence in the economy. Uncertainty of our future climate drives us to recycle more, burn more efficient fuel, reduce our emmisions and respect the environment. In a sense, it is almost motivational as once we are aware of something, we typically strive to improve it.\n",
    "In science, we frequently measure or observe things. We do this so that we can understand them better. By putting a measure on something it allows us to describe something, to visualise it or to comprehend it. Humans will design an experiment or build a model to test or measure a phenomenon and uncertainty will be the measure of the doubt that exists about the result or prediction. "

    "This project will focus on the field of dimensional metrology and more specifically, measurement systems. A measurement system might be described as a system encompassing the measuring instrument, the software, firmware, people/users, environment, method and the articles that they inspect. When designing a measurement system many aspects must be considered but ultimately the system should have an acceptable accuracy and variance for what it is designed to inspect. In conjunction with this, each measurement result should be accompanied by an uncertainty value since no measurement is ever perfect. When a measurement is taken, many phenomena can occur to influence that result and generally speaking that influence could be captured in the overall uncertainty. Estimating this uncertainy, it is possible to mitigate for the risk of misclassification based off results/observations made.         "

The component itself has 4 geometric features that must be verified through inspection, each having a nominal size and an associated tolerance. A measurement system is used to inspect the components to meet volume requirements. There is an issue with this component when it comes to final assembly. It is not fitting with other components at the final assembly plant located in another country. The equipment was installed correctly, has all the necessary certified paperwork and is passing its daily qualification checks. What is going on?\n",
